# Food @ Home
### Description
Welcome to my project! This is the Food@Home mobile app made in Swift using the SwiftUI framework. 
The Food@Home app allows users to manage the different foods and ingredients they have in their homes while also providing different meals and recipes that can be created with what the user owns. 
Utilizing the CoreData and Userdefaults frameworks the application keeps track of the user's dietary preferences, restrictions, and intolerances, while allowing users to schedule meals on their calendar to create a dietary regimen.
The meals provided are pulled from the Spoonacular Food and Recipe API with diversified results to cater to the user's specific tastes and needs.
